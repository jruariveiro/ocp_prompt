# ocp_prompt
A simple ocp prompt for zsh

For installing simply place it under your custom folder for zsh config, ie ~/$ZSH/custom and source it from your .zshrc

If you want to customize the PROMPT, edit either OC_PROMPT_SEP which by default is set to / or simply PROMPT.

You will get something like this: 

➜  kvm-install-vm  ocp:(myproject/sfo1) git:(master) ✗ 

where myproject is current namespace and sfo1 current cluster.
